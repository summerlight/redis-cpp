Redis client for C++
## History
This code was written around 2012, when there were not so many decent Redis clients for C++. Later on, for some reason, I recognized that I would not need to use Redis anymore. Therefore it eventually have been abandoned in an incomplete form, as I usually had taken a closed stance on my personal codes until they were finished.

## Why do I open-source it now?
Nowaday there is a number of good clients for C++, so you may want to use those other clients. Also, although this is an outdated, old, incomplete library, I don't have any intention to maintain it furthermore. But writing such template-black-magic codes was really fun for me, I think it deserves to be. I'd be glad if you find some value from this project.
